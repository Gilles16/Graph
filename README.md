# Monte Carlo Simulation in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation. The project demonstrates how the Monte Carlo method can be used to approximate mathematical values, such as the value of Pi, or to solve probabilistic problems.

## üìã Features

- **Approximation of Pi** using random sampling.
- **Scalable simulations** with customizable number of iterations.
- Efficient and easy-to-understand C++ code.
- Random number generation using the C++ standard library.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- CMake (optional, for building the project).
- Basic knowledge of C++ to modify or extend the simulation.
